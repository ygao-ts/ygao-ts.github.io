                <p>
                    I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Previously, I am a Ph.D. at George Mason University. My advisor is <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/">Prof. Jessica Lin</a>. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Xidian University in 2012 and received my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from Stonybrook University in 2013.  
                    </p>
         
                    <p>
                    In the broad research area of data mining and machine learning, my research focuses on 1) similarity search, motif discovery, and anomaly detection in time series; 2) spatial temporal pattern mining; 3) efficient and interpretable machine learning; 4) Interdisciplinary applications in broader areas such as health-care, user behavior analysis, and cybersecurity.
